- 👋 Hi, I’m Doug Davis
- 👀 I’m interested in Fourier Series, Partial Differential Equations, Numerical Methods, 
     Discontinuous Galerkin, Parametric space curves and surfaces,  Function approximation,
     Turbulent basis functions, High speed airbreathing propulsion, Combustion modeling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning where symbolic codes fail.
     I'm currently investigating alternate Fourier Series of the form:
     f(x)= sum a_n cos( (n-1/2) pi x / L) + sum b_n sin((n-1/2) pi x/L)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on educational applets for STEM (GeoGebra, Sagemath, Jupyter).
